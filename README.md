# JECCbot_feather_m0
This is the software implementation for https://github.com/generationmake/HighPowerMotorFeatherWing to control the JECCbot mini  outdoor robot platform ( https://github.com/generationmake/JECCbot_mini ) with a ASCII based UART protocol. The base of the software stack is implemented in ANSI C so the portation to other mikrocontroller based platforms is possible without major problems.
